# The RPG Knowledge Base
This is a curated, open-source repository of structured knowledge for video game role-playing games (RPGs). Built to support RPG designers, developers, and storytellers with precise classifications, clear taxonomies, and comprehensive catalogs of core mechanics, narrative patterns, and gameplay systems.
## Goals & Guidelines
* The main goal of this project is to define and collect definitions, classifications, taxonomies, etc., for video game RPGs that can be used in game design.  
* The knowledge collected should be independent of setting (e.g., sci-fi, fantasy, etc.), genre (Open-World RPG, Action RPG, etc.) or other constraints.  
* As an open-source project, everyone should be able to contribute.

* The files in this knowledge base use Markdown format in `Obsidian` with the `dataview` plugin, which might not render correctly in all Markdown readers or editors.
